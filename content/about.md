Hello, I’m Vivek — a climate scientist turned technologist.

I hold a PhD in Climate Science from Hokkaido University, Japan. My fascination with Earth's systems and the forces that shape our environment continues to guide how I think and work today.

Professionally, I work as a Site Reliability Engineer at Improving. My focus is on building resilient, scalable infrastructure using Kubernetes, Rancher, and various cloud platforms. I’m passionate about automation, reliability, and simplifying complex systems.

Outside of tech, I find deep meaning in solitude and nature. I love hiking through quiet trails, camping under open skies, stargazing far from city lights, and spending nights alone near water bodies — where thoughts flow as freely as rivers.

This blog is a space where science, technology, and silence come together.

📫 Feel free to connect with me or just explore.
